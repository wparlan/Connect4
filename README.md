# Connect4
This is a program that emulates a game of Connect 4 built in C++ and using the terminal to display output.
The user can play against either another user or a computer opponent who chooses randomly.
Additionally, an "arcade mode" is included, in which the user attempts to make as many connections as possible before either the board fills or the computer opponent makes a four in a row.
